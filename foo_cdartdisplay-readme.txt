This is a foobar2000 <http://www.foobar2000.org/> component that provides a
running instance of CD Art Display <http://www.cdartdisplay.com/> with various
song information.

It is an alternative to using foo_winamp_spam in that it does not simulate the
Winamp 1.x API <http://www.oldversion.com/program.php?n=winamp> but the more
powerful Helium Music Manager 2007 API <http://www.helium-music-manager.com/>.

This version of the component is written against the API specification version
1.7 dated 2008-04-24.

The source code is available under LGPL at <http://foo-cdartdisplay.googlecode.com/>.
