This is a foobar2000 0.9.x <http://www.foobar2000.org/> component to interface
with CD Art Display 1.x <http://www.closetosoftware.com/?s=cdartdisplay>.

It is an alternative to using foo_winamp_spam in that it does not simulate the
Winamp 1.x API <http://www.oldversion.com/program.php?n=winamp> but the more
powerful Helium Music Manager 2007 API <http://www.helium-music-manager.com/>.

This version of the component is written against the API specification version
1.8 dated 2007-09-25.
