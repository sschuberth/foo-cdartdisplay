# About

This is a [foobar2000](http://www.foobar2000.org/) component that provides a running instance of [CD Art Display](http://cdartdisplay.byethost8.com/) with various song information.

It is an alternative to using foo_winamp_spam in that it does not simulate the
Winamp 1.x API <http://www.oldversion.com/program.php?n=winamp> but the more
powerful Helium Music Manager 2007 API <http://www.helium-music-manager.com/>.
